					<span class="style2">NeuroMama.com UNIQUE Marketing Strategy</span>
					</br>
					You want to know how people are going to hear about www.NeuroMama.com?  What's going to draw them in the first place? 


					Number one, we're going to spend a lot of money on marketing. Among other things,<b class="innerbold">we're going to buy the phrase "Better Search Engine" on Google AdWords.  And since no one is bidding on that phrase, we can get it really cheap, under a penny per click.</b>

					So when people go to Google.com, <b class="innerbold">more times than not…. they'll see our ad at the top in the right column</b> because there really isn't much competition ... nobody is buying AdWords for search engines.

					So they will see that once, twice, three times when they go to Google and ... you know something, human psychology being what it is, about the fourth or fifth time they'll be curious enough to click on it and <b class="innerbold">they will go to NeuroMama.com and learn about our rewards program and our neural-intelligence enhanced search technology and they'll try it.</b>

					We will do the same with Facebook. The only thing with Facebook we have hands on experience and much more control than with Google. We'll connect NeuroMama.com to Facebook. The same way we had connected a half a dozen of our video games. Connecting our video games to a Facebook platform, has given all Facebook users an instant access to our video games the same way they have access to ZYNGA games. 

					This time around we'll buy from Facebook ads, which will say <b class="innerbold">"Better Search Engine." To make sure that we don't pay more than a penny per click, these ads will be displayed only to Facebook users, who had used "Google Search" or "Googled" at one time or another. 

					We're also going to buy the phrase "Better Search Engine" on Facebook AdWords.  And since no one is bidding on that phrase, we can get it also really cheap.</b>

					<span class="style2">Frequent Searcher Rewards</span>
					</br>
					People are going to really love and become addicted to NeuroMama's FSR program. FSR ... Frequent Searcher Rewards. It's just like an airline frequent flyer program only better. 

					With FSR, users get points every time they enter a search or send or receive an email using NeuroMama's ultra- secure, bulletproof, web mail service. They even get free bonus points if, for some reason, the service doesn't perform up to expectations. If, for example, a search takes a half second or so too long to complete. 

					With FSR, users get points every time their referrals, and the referrals of their referrals enter a search or send or receive an email using NeuroMama's web mail service, and get free bonus points when the search takes a half second or so too long to complete. 

					This is the solution for Multi-Level Marketing for NeuroMama.com and its users, who will be earning free points for everyone whom they had introduced to NeuroMama.com.  

					With points redeemable for free travel, upscale electronics, online education, game play, software … all kinds of products and services ... people will never be tempted to use another search engine. Tens, hundreds of millions of them, will make NeuroMama their default search engine, their SEARCH ENGINE OF CHOICE. 

					What will happen then? Advertisers all over the world: Fortune 500 advertisers, mom & pop ecommerce advertisers. Advertisers WILL MAKE <b class="innerbold">NEUROMAMA</b> THEIR MARKETING SEARCH ENGINE OF CHOICE FOR THEIR MONEY. 
					</br>
					<b class="innerbold">They'll try it and once they try it, THEY'LL BE OURS. They'll see that NEUROMAMA delivers everything we promise and more and THEY WILL BE OURS FOREVER. And they will go on Facebook and Twitter and tell all their friends about this great new search engine they found.</b>
					</br>
					Number two ... is the media. We're going to get <b class="innerbold">more free media coverage than any new software tool</b> beyond the obvious universal…. ones like Windows 8, or a new Microsoft Office Suite, or a complete Facebook redesign ... but, beyond that….  <b class="innerbold">We will get the most massive coverage of any new product in this century.</b>

					Because (a) ... No one has ever applied neural programming to search engine technology. So that guarantees <b class="innerbold">NeuroMama.com coverage by all the technology and webmaster and computer geek media outlets.</b>

					And (b) ... No one has ever launched a search engine before by offering a loyalty program, free premiums or any incentives whatsoever ... <b class="innerbold">that guarantees us coverage by all the sales and marketing media outlets.  </b>

					And (c) ... No one has introduced a search engine --- especially a revolutionary, game-changing search engine like NeuroMama – and gotten it ready to go public in almost a decade. <b class="innerbold">Ten years.That alone will make our launch big news in all the financial news outlets. </b>
					</br></br>
					
					
					
					<span class="style2">Who is NeuroMama?</span>
					</br>
					And there's an intangible factor that's even more important ... <b class="innerbold">we, as a company are simply better at manipulating the media than other companies. We have better news release writers, we have marketing communications executives with better contact lists, the girls making "vendor visitors" to demonstrate NeuroMama.com to editors, reporters and financial analysts will be younger, prettier, smarter and sexier</b> than women doing the same job for other companies.

					<b class="innerbold">And this is just the tip of the NeuroMama marketing iceberg ... the traditional marketing.</b>
					That doesn't even include new media, <b class="innerbold">viral marketing, and the fastest, best and most effective way to promote anything on the internet.

					Let me ask you a question. What has been the most successful form of advertising?</b>

					You guessed it. Word of mouth advertising... it's never been beat, not by TV, not by anything...

					</br></br>
					
					
					
					
					<span class="style2">Viral Marketing</span>
					</br>
					<b class="innerbold">Viral marketing is the word of mouth advertising of the Internet Age.</b> You create a clever marketing message that will get some hits on a site like YouTube and from there ….. people see it and put the link on their Facebook page, or in a blog, or they Tweet about it and suddenly – <b class="innerbold">suddenly as in a week or less – it spreads like a virus and your message is being seen by 700, 800, 900 million new people a day.</b>

					So for our first series of viral videos we're making comic 90-second slices of life stories of people enjoying the premiums they got from using NEUROMAMA as their search engine. But they're using them in weird and funny ways... 

					</br></br>Copy and paste the link bellow. This is the first viral video.</br>

					<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOn_jBQOxzs&feature=youtu.be">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOn_jBQOxzs&feature=youtu.be</a></br>

					And to make sure our viral videos do get seen by hundreds of millions of people as soon as we release them we've brought <b class="innerbold">Tom Brennan as a part of our management team, the Godfather of Viral Marketing, to manage the VM campaign for NEUROMAMA.  </b>
					</br></br>
					
					

					<span class="style2">Tom Bernan</span>
					</br>
					Let me tell you a little something about Tom, in addition to being the founder and CEO of two ground-breaking viral marketing agencies, Tom wrote the Bible on the viral video marketing ... the Viral Video Handbook, the best-selling book ever written on the subject by a factor of more than three-to-one.

					</br>

					<span class="style2">Launch of NeuroMama.com!!!</span>
					</br>
					NeuroMama.com’s <b class="innerbold">launch will be going live supported by the biggest, MOST INNOVATIVE, NEUROMAMA MARKETING CAMPAIGN in the history of the entertainment industry.</b>
					You know how some companies roll out new businesses with a soft launch? At NeuroMama, we don’t believe in soft. 
					WE BELIEVE IN SPECTACULAR. Spectacular is what builds revenues FAST.
					</br>
					<b class="innerbold">SPECTACULAR is what DRIVES SHARE PRICES THROUGH THE ROOF.</b>
					</br>
					Spectacular? How spectacular? As SPECTACULAR as 144 hours of continuous live performances by some of the most famous and honored entertainers in the world. As SPECTACULAR as a continuous series of happenings that no financial, broadcast, print, electronic, entertainment, or general NEWS SERVICE WOULD DARE IGNORE. 
					The <b class="innerbold">SPECTACULAR</b> launch of NeuroMama.com will start at the same time Wall Street, Las Vegas and St. Petersburg, Russia…………… and will make the INTERNATIONAL NEWS.
					</br></br>
		
					
					<span class="style2">144 hours the Live Entertainment Fundraiser Will be streamed on NeuroMama.com</span>
					</br>
					The launch will receive massive TV, Radio and other national and international media coverage.
					NeuroMama and NeuroMama.com is structured to earn profits for shareholders, as well as to use its engine to make this world a better, healthier planet… A better place for our children and grandchildren and their children to grow up in, to thrive in … a world they can truly become all that they can be and all that we would hope them to be.

					To do this, we intend to raise hundreds of millions of dollars, none of it investors’ money, for charitable purposes. 
					Let me give you some examples:
					</br></br>
					
					
					<span class="style2">Neuromama - Mition</span>
					</br>
					In the environmental area we will be supporting efforts to shut down a proposed nuclear plant near Lake Baikal, the deepest, purest lake in the world, which contains 20% of all unfrozen worlds fresh water surface. This nuclear plant, if not stopped, has the potential to Chernobyl seem like a backyard bonfire if and when disaster strikes.
					We also intend to do our part to bring the reality of NeuroMama warming and the melting icecaps home to people. Do you know that 80% of the ice cover on Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa, a glacier that has existed for 11,700 years, has disappeared in the last hundred years? Even more frightening, the annual loss -- which was 1% between 1912 in 1953 -- has escalated to 2.5% in more recent times. As that rate, Mount Kilimanjaro will be totally ice free in as little as 10 years. This is a real fact of NeuroMama warming. 
					Just imagine what kind of havoc that rate of change will have in the millions of acres beneath that mountain. 
					In Russia, along with our efforts to shut down the nuclear plant near Lake Baikal we will also work to stop the ongoing destruction of the Siberian forests … forests which currently contain 25% of the world's trees and generate 25% of the planet’s oxygen.
					Understand this, <b class="innerbold">we are not just going to talk about these evils, we are going to be very proactive. A completely separate from NeuroMama entity Amnistya Children’s Foundation will be created, which will use fundraising in fighting them.</b></br>
					Particularly in the legal area, where Amnistya Children’s Foundation will file lawsuits in the countries affected and in the international courts.</b> Amnistya Children’s Foundation will sue everyone involved in these ecological rapes, companies, directors, politicians, whoever. 
					On the cultural front, Amnistya Children’s Foundation will support artists, musicians, sculptors, architects… anyone who devotes their talents to the creation of classical art in music of artistic creations that embody a theme of timeless beauty, cultural tradition, and convey a sense of trust and security.
					Amnistya Children’s Foundation will also provide worldwide support for the sport of rhythmic gymnastics, which is the fastest growing and trauma free, the safest Olympic sport for young girls. A rhythmic gymnastics sport has weekly ballet classes, and gives girls unique opportunities for artistic expression and safety. Soccer, basketball, baseball, hockey and even boxing are the choices of sports for our daughters and granddaughters. All of these sports take away their femininity and abilities to stay healthy mothers. If you're not sure of what this spectacular, exquisite sport is all about just go to YouTube and search for rhythmic gymnastics.
					On the educational front, Amnistya Children’s Foundationwill provide financial support to children who want to get an education, and can't afford it, as well as providing financial support to Universities to be able to afford to hire better teachers and professors, to build research facilities and to equip them with the most technologically advanced tools.
					One more very important thing, Amnistya Children’s Foundationin addition to its own charitable activities, will enable both existing charitable organizations and individual compassionate people to more easily engage in fundraising for good causes.
					Amnistya Children’s Foundation will provide protection to donors by screening individuals and groups claiming to be legitimate charities.
					It'll provide back office functions such as collections, recordkeeping, filings, providing tax recent receipts to claim deductions, etc. to nonprofit organizations.
					That's just a few of many services NeuroMama will be providing to the good people, the generous people, of the world.
					NeuroMama.com will also provide communication channels – TV spots, billboards, radio messages, etc. -- for the major institutional and individual charitable donors serving on NeuroMama.com’s board to reach out to individual donors. 
					Just so you know, we already have many of Who’s Who of key people interested in sitting on that board. 
					Facebook, which is, among everything else it is, a meeting place for predators, child molesters and terrorists has gone public in <b class="innerbold">the biggest IPO.</b> How much more do you think a network like NeuroMama.com, a network with a soul and a conscience will be worth a few years down the road?</br>
					<b class="innerbold">Its value is incalculable and this is how the initial marketing campaign will work. </b>

					</br></br>


					<span class="style2">Google.... Google ... Google... Google...</span>
					</br>
					<b class="innerbold">If you still don't believe we can beat Google at its own game. Less than ten years ago ... that's what every so-called smart guy said about Yahoo. Nobody could beat Yahoo.</b>

					Google had a better system, a better idea, they were younger and faster ... and the rest is history.

					And where's Yahoo now? Yahoo is still around, and making money. How many CEOs has Yahoo fired in the past 18 months? Five, or are they up to six? 

					Still… Yahoo made a ton of money for its original investors. They all got rich. All the original investors, all the venture capitalists who financed all the search engines… got rich.

					Every search engine in internet history that launched and went public made its ground floor investors rich. Most of them are gone today, killed by Yahoo or Google or Microsoft ... but in their day every one of them went through the roof at their IPO.

					That's one of the things that make a new, revolutionary search engine like NeuroMama.com such a once-in-a-lifetime chance to turn an investment into a true fortune with RELATIVELY LITTLE RISK.

					<b class="innerbold">Maybe you’d be reassured to know that Google isn't really competing in the search engine arena anymore. </b>

					</br></br>
					<b class="innerbold">Google not competing in Search Business</b></br>

					With a cap value of $290 billion Google is the third richest company in the United States right now and it will pass, as analysts claim,Apple Computers by the end of the year. It is a company that made every one of its original investors not just rich, but filthy rich. At more than $850 a share it is still making investors rich.

					But Google is much more than that. Google is one of the ten greatest companies ever created. Ever created … in any country, during any period of history … one of the greatest companies EVER!

					Because it has a Top ten set of brains running it … the brains of Sergey Brin and Larry Page. And what Sergey Brin and Larry Pate recognize better than other business executives is that the processes of evolution and maturation effect companies just as much as they do people.

					They know that companies like Google go through different stages of life just like people. And what Sergey Brin and Larry Page realized a long time ago … as long ago as Google’s 2004 IPO, according to some former Google executives … what they realized was that Google's heart, soul and core revenue producer -- Google Search -- was going to run into a bunch of walls in less than ten years.

					Concrete walls created and imposed by Uncle Sam’s antitrust czars that cap the income it can earn from search advertising - its primary source of revenue, and limiting the acquisition of new users, now that the number of households with internet access has exceeded critical mass. 

					What Sergey Brin and Larry Page realized was that Google Search could only go so far and no farther. 

					Incredibly, almost unbelievably far, true ... but still there would come a point where Google Search would top out ... a point beyond which it could not be pushed no matter how much money they threw at it.

					So they stopped throwing money at it right then and there. Instead they silently and stealthily began shifting the bulk of their research and development brains and dollars into other projects. Projects to invent products that would eventually replace Search as Google’s core revenue engine.

					This is why … Google has never brought its search engine technology into the 21st Century. Why it is still using obsolete technology designed in the mid-1990s to optimally work with a Dialup, 56K modem-driven internet.

					Instead of reinventing Google Search for the 21st Century, Google was investing in other things ... things like the fastest broadband internet service technology on earth -- ten times faster than FIOS, the previous gold standard, and 100 to 150 times faster than the average "high speed" cable or DSL internet service available in the U.S. today.

					Broadband technology, that delivers downloads at 1 gigabyte per second -- a full Blu-ray DVD in less than a minute. That's one thing Google invested in instead of a faster search engine. And it works. People in Google's Kansas City Missouri test market are enjoying it today.

					And it doesn't matter ... doesn't matter whether Google decides to build out from Kansas City itself or license its technology to existing operators like Time-Warner, Comcast, etc. Either way the eventual annual revenue will dwarf what they now make from Google Search.

					And then there’s the other major project, even bigger project. 

					Today in three states – California, Nevada and Florida – is actually legal to own and operate a driverless car on the public roads. A street legal driverless car, think of that … a car which automatically takes you where you want to go while you sit and study stock quotes.

					Google is the only company with a viable driverless car platform, the only company that has racked up millions of flawless miles road testing driverless cars, the only company with employees who regular commute to and from work (on California freeways, no less) in driverless cars.

					They’ve been working on driverless cars for more than five years now. And the profit potential from that technology also dwarfs what they are now making or could ever make from their search engine.

					This is why Google’s best brains and biggest R&D budgets have nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with Google Search?

					This is why there is a huge hole in cyberspace waiting to be filled by a 21st Century, next generation, and neural-programming powered search engine. 

					Once NeuroMama.org will go live in January, it will quickly do to Google Search what Google did to Yahoo ten years ago. 
					</br></br>
					
					
					
					
					
					
					
					
					<span class="style2">Facebook is an Exception</span>
					</br>
					<b class="innerbold">Facebook is a dishonest, dishonorable train wreck. A house of cards supported by a tissue of lies and a basement full of cooked books … statements which have been fully proven. </b>

					Fully proven by the revelations of phony membership and usage claims, that has come out since the Facebook IPO.

					Fully proven by the defection of major advertisers like General Motors, major advertisers fed up with the lack of measurable ROI on their Facebook placements.

					Like our search engine, our social network -- NewPureGlobe.com, which will be in beta within one year -- will be based on advanced neural technology and totally engineered to meet the needs of real people anxious to use the magic of the internet to enrich their own lives and those of their friends and families.

					</br></br>
					<b class="innerbold">Facebook search engine… is total Nonsense!</b></br>
					They're just trying to manipulate their stock and shift attention away from how shaky Facebook's numbers are.</br>

					We recently ran some comparison tests of Google vs. Bing and Google is so far ahead of Bing it’s ridiculous ... if Facebook is going to use Bing to power their search they're will most definitely fail.

					But, it's good for us ... the more the real search engines like Microsoft and Google get suckered into expanding social search the better opportunity for NEUROMAMA.</br>

					At the end of the day, people looking for information on where to get the best refrigerator or find information on Stalin's first five-year-plan don't want results crapped up with a bunch of links to nitwits on Facebook or Twitter who may have used the word refrigerator or Stalin in a post once.</br>

					As a marketing gimmick an integrated Social Network and search engine sounds great, that's why we'll use it ourselves. But as a practical tool, the integrated search is like all one-size-fits-all solutions, it doesn't fit anyone very well.

					When the time is right, we'll turn the argument around and talk about the advantages of pure search, something that puts all the content of all the 8 billion websites at the tip of your fingers without diluting it with gossip, clutter and 140 character snippets that tell you nothing.

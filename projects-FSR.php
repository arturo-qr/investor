Choosing “Paris,” as an example, they will be instantly hyperlinked to a 3D, fully animated virtual representation of the Boulevard Saint Michel, or the Rue Saint Honoré, or the Champs Elysées. Strolling through these legendary shopping districts they will find the intriguing storefronts of the NeuroZone’s Parisian vendors, each of them thematically rendered to perfectly mesh with the architectural style, color palette and overall ambience of the district they’re in and the simulated buildings surrounding them.					</br></br>					Entering a tenant’s establishment, NeuroZone visitors will be presented with a shopping experience that as closely mimics what they would find in the brick and mortar version of the store as possible. 					</br></br>					Does that Tenant typically service brick-and-mortar customers by having live sales “consultants” present the latest fashions in clothes, jewelry and accessories with runway models displaying them one piece or outfit at time? Our virtual consultants and models are expected to digitally duplicate that experience.					</br></br>					Were you actually in Paris scouting the boutiques in the Butte aux Cailles, you might easily exit a fashion house such as the one above, cross the narrow cobblestone street and find yourself in a young, edgy, trendy clothes emporium where the entire stock is crammed onto racks, stuffed into bins or heaped on tables that might be in the middle of a particular aisle at 4 p.m. and somewhere else entirely at 7. 					</br></br>					In the NeuroZone, this business model will also be faithfully replicated in pixels by our advanced 3D rendering and predictive behavior algorithms. Shoppers will be able to smoothly mouse through the store and slide hangers back and forth on the racks before selecting one to pull down and examine in full multi-dimensional, 360-degree-rotatable form.   Likewise, shoppers will be able to virtually root through bins and tables full of merchandise as mini-descriptions and -- where applicable -- special price offers and deals pop up in a transparent window for each item they highlight.  Never before has Internet shopping been like this. Never before has any company even attempted to so boldly meld advanced e-commerce, video game animation, relational object modeling simulation technologies into a single application totally dedicated to recreating a real-world commercial environment in pixels and silicone, algorithms and assumptions, zero and one digits and multi-dimensional display scenarios.					</br></br>					And never before has an Internet shopping service been marketed like the NeuroZone. In developing the NeuroZone, we started with one advantage that no other major Web retailer, no matter how massive its presence, has, a true partnership with a major search engine. Not a “strategic relationship,” not a “cross-branding agreement,” not a “data-sharing contract” But a real parent-child relationship, with NeuroMama.com being the NeuroPlatform, providing to an end-user with experiences found today on many different sites and yet to be discovered only on NeuroPlatform.					</br></br>					From this basis, we expect to continually add new and exciting rewards to the FSR Store.  Typical rewards such as all loyalty programs offer – advanced electronics, travel, luggage, gourmet food packs, etc. – and new exciting rewards unoffered by airlines or other businesses. 					</br></br>					New exciting rewards selected especially to appeal to our highly Internet savvy end users. Rewards like hundreds of free hours of play on the Web's most popular game sites, free classes from some of the best online universities, free ebook and audiobook downloads, free movie rentals, discounted software and free Android App upgrades.					</br></br>					Once again, as with our current rewards offers, all these products, despite being free to FSR members, should, under our current marketing plan, return substantial positive revenue to NeuroMama as they will be obtained by bartering advertising discounts to their vendors.					</br></br>					For example, a typical barter arrangement might be structured on an 80/20 basis with the advertiser paying for the ad with 80 % product and 20 % cash.					</br></br>					<span class="style2">NeuroMama Vacation Club is a part of the Frequent Searcher/Shopper Rewards program.</span>					</br>					Currently, a lot of progress is underway to convert premium retail space in the Las Vegas Fashion Show Mall to the first of three planned sales offices for NeuroMama’s initial brick-and-mortar resort initiative, the NeuroMama Vacation Club.					</br></br>					NeuroMama Vacation Club in Las Vegas is intended to serve as a prototype for similar ventures in other tourist hotspots throughout the world as well as a standalone profit center.  The NeuroMama Vacation Club’s inventory of premium casino/hotel packages are expected to be obtained on consignment at deeply discounted wholesale rates or barter for NeuroMama.com advertising or a combination of cash and advertising.					</br></br>					Buying a membership in the Club for $2,000 to $20,000 will entitle a member to a free NeuroPad and other promotional merchandise and numerous discounted and free perks such as below-lowest-advertised-discount room rates, free accommodation upgrades, VIP shows and sporting event seat locations, special dining and beverage offers, free admission to select Aces of Acts performances and free gaming match chips, slot club memberships and other offers of special interest to gamblers. 					</br></br>					The NeuroMama Vacation Club will also form an integral part of NeuroMama.com’s Frequent Searcher/Shopper Rewards program, with participants in the program eligible to select a free stay in one of the Club’s inventory of available rooms after earning a specified number of points. Although the initial stay in the hotel (number of nights to be determined by number of FSR points required) will be free, food, beverages, entertainment and additional nights beyond those covered by earned points will be charged at regular rates, thus producing a reasonable program ROI for NeuroMama.   				</div>			</div>		</div>	</body></html>

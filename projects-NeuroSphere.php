With analysts at the highly respected market tracking firm of DFC Intelligence predict that the educational games market will reach $5 billion in 2016, we believe NeuroSphere’s and NeuroPlay’s contributions to NeuroMama’s bottom-line will be both substantial and sustaining in all near- mid- and long-term financial scenarios.				</div>			</div>		</div>	</body></html>

					<div class="style1">Entertainment Assets-Long Term Strategy</div>
					</br>
					We know you are a sophisticated investor who gets pitches from people constantly...

					So I ask you, visualize some of the other investments you've been offered lately.</br>

					<b class="innerbold">Do any of them bring up a picture of billions of people being happy using NeuroMama’s products and services 24 hours per day? </br>

					A gleaming, beautifully developed millions of TV programs being watched all over the world on their Smart-phone type devices, I-Pads, computers and televisions at home, on the streets, in the car and the offices? </br>

					Billions of people, who are paying monthly subscription fee to NeuroMama? </br>

					And a mail box with an envelope every quarter with a dividend check from NeuroMama, and a tremendous stock appreciation ... due to being a shareholder in a company that owns a huge library of Entertainment Assets as a safety net? 

					Entertainment Assets are entirely different from typical business assets.</b></br> They shouldn't even be called assets, but there's no other word for them in the English language. 

					Let's say you've got a store or a warehouse or an ecommerce site, the asset value of inventory is limited by what it can earn from a single sale. 

					The same thing is true even with an airline where the inventory is empty seats that can be sold over and over and over. The value of those assets, those empty seats, is still limited by the law of diminishing returns. Their value decreases geometrically as the aircraft gets older, the amount of time it is available for service goes down and the cost of maintenance and inspections goes up. 

					NeuroMama Assets. A real crown jewel. Next to NeuroMama.com, maybe my favorite of all the NeuroMama companies because its assets are so timeless, so hardened against inflation, deflation, boom, bust, bears, bulls … everything short of World War III</br>
					NeuroMama Assets is much more than a holding company. A holding company, legally and traditionally, is one company that holds stock – usually, but not always, a controlling interest in another company.
					NeuroMama Assets, though it retains stock in all our other entities, is far, far more than that. NeuroMama Assets is the glue that holds the whole enterprise together, the engine pulling all the other cars in the train.

					<span class="style2">Entertainment</span>
					</br>
					Assets is the safety net that guarantees that NeuroMama will continue to achieve substantial and continual profits regardless of declines in one or more aspects of the entertainment industry.
					Entertainment Assets is our Fort Knox. A portfolio, for lack of a better term where we keep the corporate treasure. The “gold and diamonds” whose value remains unaffected by changes in currency rates, inflation, deflation or any other economic trauma.</br>
					What entertainment Assets controls are the most gild-edged assets any Information Age company can have.</br>
					Assets which are better than cash because their value isn’t decreased by inflation. Assets that area also known as “intellectual property.”
					These assets are better than precious metals, where the number of really major buyers is limited and prices can fluctuate tremendously based on individual country's economic policies. They are infinitely better assets than a blue-chip stock portfolio … unless you don't remember that American Airlines, General Motors, Fannie Mae, Chrysler and so many other bankrupts were once considered blue chips.
					In a sense, these assets are better than patents because patents timeout and expire in 18 years whereas most of our intellectual property will be legally protected for up to 120 years. (Note: The entire company’s technological patent portfolio will also be managed by NeuroMama Assets and these will, of course, be subject to the 18-year expiration limit.) </br></br>
					Most of these assets will be entertainment programming. Billions of dollars worth of entertainment programming, tens of thousands of featured films, hundreds of thousands of hours of broadcast and cable TV series, special events, sports, and education programs. Millions of hours of programs and an ever-expanding collection of exclusive online games designed by our own in-house gaming division.
					These assets can be divided into two categories, those which we own outright and those for which we hold exclusive distribution and exploitation rights for the countries and continents in which we do business. 
					It doesn't matter which category a particular program is in, its value as a NeuroMama Asset is the same … because the value is the amount of revenue the asset will generate over the many decades will we have exclusive rights to it. 
					Entertainment assets are beautiful things. They have no moving parts, they never break down, they never need maintenance and repair. They have no physical footprint; they exist only as digital files on computer servers. The cost of warehousing ten billion dollars worth of entertainment programming is so negligible it won't even show up as a line item on a balance sheet.
					But maybe, just maybe the best thing about entertainment assets is that they are never, ever sold. They are never even rented in the sense that the customer gets to take it home and use it.  NeuroMama Asset’s property, as licensed to our various brother and sister companies, can be rented to 2000, 10,000, a hundred thousand customers simultaneously. 
					And the residual value, the income that each of those assets generates every time a customer accesses it remains the same day after day, week after week, year after year. There is only appreciation, never depreciation with these assets.</br>
					<b class="innerbold">You will also get equity in a library of Entertainment Assets.</b>

					We are certain, that you've been thinking about NeuroMama and saying to yourself, "yes, no, maybe, on one hand, on the other hand, should I ... shouldn't I, is this really the opportunity I've been waiting all my life for?"</br></br>

					<b class="innerbold">Is this it?</b> The one that's going to hit big time? After all the failures, after all the near misses, after all the deals that paid off, but only in chump change? <b class="innerbold">Is NeuroMama really the company that's going to make me rich?</b></br></br>

					Yes, NeuroMama is the winner, the company…the conglomerate of companies, actually … that is going to make you rich. That is going to make you wealthy. That is going to wash away all the memories of bad investments, broker rip-offs, and dreams that just faded away and died.</br></br>

					We are certain that years later… our initiative will be… as history will say… a stunning success, one of the most amazing feats in the history of publicly trading companies making money for long term investors…</br></br>

					We can see “through” market conditions, strengths of competition, weakness in the economy, and political uncertainties. </br></br>

					We can see, what it would mean to you, your spouse, your kids and grandkids, which may have to budget and spend money only on the most important things. </br></br>

					We can see what it would mean to any investor, who may have lost money on the few deals, or still waiting for an exit on few others -- and this gives our management team the vision to see what we need to do to make it succeed.</br></br>

					<span class="style2">Risk</span>
					</br>
					Another important risk-reduction factor is the nature of the business.

					In 2004 more than 70 percent of Internet users in America were connected to the web through a dial-up modem that, among many other flaws, made it impossible for Web surfers to use their telephones while they were online. Today over 90 percent of users have always-on broadband connections.

					This quantum leap in connectivity makes an advanced new search engine a much more promising and far less risky investment than Yahoo was in the ‘90s and Google was in 2004.

					It is reasonable to point out, however, that Google and Yahoo, despite their limited earnings, despite the dot.com meltdown, despite the investment community’s uncertainty about the future of e-commerce, generally, were never particularly risky investments, because every search engine IPO in the history of the Internet has been successful, wildly successful.

					Every search engine IPO ever launched delivered enormous profits to the initial investors. Lycos, Alta Vista, Magellan, InfoSeek … all of them … made their ground-floor, private backers very, very wealthy.

					<b class="innerbold">We are highly confident that NeuroMama, LTD. Secondary offering will do the same … only more so.</b>

					<span class="style2">Example on Google</span>

					<b class="innerbold">To make sure that you immediately understand everything, let’s try a little experiment. Let’s search for something that isn't going to be affected by where you live? "Computer software" That should be easy.</b>
					</br>
					Here's the first return page ... you don't see microsoft.com. That's weird ... you need to dig a little deeper into these returns.

					Finally ... here it is on page 11... a link to Microsoft's page. Let's open it up and ... but wait, that isn't a link to a  Microsoft.com marketing website ... it's a just a tech support page on how to run WMI task scripts, whatever those are.

					I guess we have to move on.... here's something from Microsoft on page 14, a blog entry about making your computer run faster... not exactly a link to their computer software pages is it?

					Nothing at all on page 15, nothing on page 16, nothing on page 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, or 31.

					You understand what we just did, right? We Googled Computer Software and Google couldn't produce a link to the world's biggest, wealthiest, most important computer software company in history. 

					It couldn't produce that link anywhere in its first THIRTY return pages. And every study on the subject, every study ever made shows people give up on a search – give up, just plain stop looking at the returns – if what they want doesn't show up in the first page and a half.
					</br>
					<b class="innerbold">So now ... does it surprise you we're about to release the next landmark search engine?</b>
					</br>
					Would you like to hear the names of some software companies Google thinks are more important than Microsoft? 
					</br></br>
					*Common Craft, whoever they are.</br> 
					*Texas Instruments, which isn't even, primarily, a software maker.</br> 
					*Computer Software, Inc., another household name.</br>
					*Broderbond.... they publish the Mavis Bacon Typing program, clearly more important – at least to Google – than Microsoft Office.</br>
					*CSA, Inc ... your guess is as good as mine </br>
					*NCH ... a fringe manufacturer of audio editing shareware... </br>
					</br>
					And a bunch more no-name developers with one or two software applications used by maybe a few thousand people. 
					</br>
					And, of course, there are the software vendors. For example Google reminds us that Amazon sells software no less than five times on the first four return pages.
					</br>
					<b class="innerbold">You want to know something even more pathetic than Microsoft’s home page not showing up in Google's first thirty return pages?</b>

					</br></br>
					
					<span class="style2">Example on Bing</span>
					</br>
					<b class="innerbold">Microsoft.com doesn't show up until page 56 on a search for “computer software” using Bing search engine.</b> That's right, Bing, Microsoft's very own, brand new search engine, and its multi-billion dollar competitor to Google. 
					</br>
					This is crazy, insane, and stupid. Bill Gate's own search engine ranks "Microsoft Corporation: Software, Smartphone’s, Online, Games," as the last return on page 56 …

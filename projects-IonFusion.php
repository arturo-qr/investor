Unlike fossil fuels, it releases no hydrocarbons or other pollutants into the atmosphere, contributes nothing to global warming and, since it is fueled by hydrogen atoms, the only natural resource it requires is water which, while in short supply in some areas, is available in abundance in most places on earth. 					</br></br>					Unlike the much more familiar (think Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Three-Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima) nuclear fission technology, atomic fusion reactions are not dependent on such highly explosive elements as uranium or plutonium, thus eliminating the possibility of catastrophic chain reactions such as occurred when reactors failed at Chernobyl and Fukushima. In a fusion reactor, such failures would result in harmless shutdowns rather than deadly meltdowns.					</br></br>					The Ion Fusion is the carrot which was recently handed to NeuroMama by a group of scientists and university professors and their colleagues who have been using the beta version of NeuroMama.com in their research and recently filed for a patent on a totally new approach to creating a fusion reaction by applying chemical, rather than physical, pressure to hydrogen atoms.					</br></br>					For a significant percentage of their patent rights, they have asked us to recruit our contacts in the Eastern European scientific research community to help perfect and develop the processes described in their patent and to use NeuroMama’s unparalleled ability to disseminate information to help promote a planned demonstration project in which atomic fusion would be used to power an aqueduct system delivering water to drought-stricken parts of the Southwest United States and Mexico.					</br></br>					That’s the carrot. The stick is that some of the best brains in the scientific community have been trying to create a large-scale, economically feasible fusion reaction since the latter days of the Manhattan Project that invented the atomic bomb almost 70 years ago.					</br></br>					There’s also an unknown but somewhat encouraging factor. Despite almost seven decades of failure, the scientific community, by and large, still believes that atomic fusion is not a myth, not an impossibility, not a technology with no future.  Quite to the contrary, the prevailing opinion is that atomic fusion should have, could have, would have, and will have a major role to play as an energy supplier to tomorrow’s world as soon as someone somewhere figures out how to make it work.					</br></br>					As evidence of this attitude one need look no further than the science news reports from May 24, 2012. On that day, in an almost unprecedented display of international cooperation in the realm of pure scientific research, the governments of the United States, the European Union, Russia, China, South Korea, Japan and India agreed to jointly finance an experimental $14 billion atomic fusion reactor scheduled to go online in the south of France some time in 2016.					</br></br>					IMPORTANT NOTE AND DISCLAIMER: Among respectable, totally qualified scientists and other experts, the subject of atomic fusion has long been almost as explosive as its “evil” twin atomic fission. While there is little doubt that fusion is possible and even attainable as long as the amount of energy produced is miniscule, there is heated debate as to whether production of enough energy to be useful for anything can be achieved without costing substantially more per unit of energy produced than alternative sources.					</br></br>					Therefore we would like to emphasize that NeuroMama’s NeuroFusion involvement with the fusion project at this point is strictly limited to having experts at institutions of higher learning already collaborating with us on other projects to study the feasibility of the patent filings presented to us. We have not, to date, invested a single dollar in atomic fusion and none of the financial, marketing or other data referenced in this filing has in any way been impacted positively, negatively or in any other way by projections based on any participation by NeuroMama in this or any other project involving atomic fusion. 					</br></br>					However, we are planning to package this project for further promotion by investing in the Point of Sale material for Ion Fusion project and use our strategic contacts in Eastern Europe, China, Mexico and US, such as the political, natural resources exploration companies, producers of steel, cooper, aluminums and other building materials as well as strategic investors.					</br></br>					The optimum goal for NeuroMama is to use its contacts and strategic European investors’ money to structure the NeuroFusion project where NeuroMama will maintain controlling interest.							</div>			</div>		</div>	</body></html>

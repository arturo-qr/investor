					<span class="style2">Advantages of Neural Technology</span>
					</br>
					Our search engine is better than Google, because it is based on Neural Technology. What does it mean?</br>
					Regular computer programs are only as smart as the team of people, who have designed them. Computer programs, which have been used to operate Google and all other search engines, are regular computer programs.
					</br>
					Computer systems designed with Neural Technology, are based on very complex mathematical algorithms and are programmed to learn from people who are using these systems. To implement Neural Technology solutions, first a person must be a scientist mathematician, who knows computer programming. Not a computer programmer, who knows some mathematics. 
					</br>
					How much more advanced Neural Technology based computer systems versus regular systems? For example, if you take only 1,000,000 people with an average age of 30 years, who will be using our search engine. By learning from these 1,000,000 people our search engine will acquire wisdom of 30,000,000 years. Today is 2013.
					</br>
					What if 100,000,000 people will be using our search engine? Our search engine will acquire 3 billion years of knowledge, experience and wisdom. How many people could have been working on research, design, development and implementation of Google? 100? 200? 500?
					</br>
					Now do you understand the advantages of implementing Neural Technology in the Search Engine’s computer based system? 
					</br>
					It is common knowledge that former USSR and now Russian mathematicians are exceptionally well educated, and this is why Russian professors of mathematics are teaching today in most of the world's prestigious universities, as well as in many other universities.

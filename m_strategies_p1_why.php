					</br></br>
					NeuroMama, whose neural programming-driven website analysis and ranking protocols will produce search returns of unparalleled speed and precision, will be the only search engine in existence that isn’t running on technology developed in the mid-1990s.
					</br></br>
					Why do people use Google and the other search engines? They use them because they have to.... not because they love them.
					</br></br>
					But NeuroMama.com is different kind of search engine. NeuroMama is a search engine users are going to love. They're going to love it because it will do exactly what they want it to do. It will do what no other search engine is able to do. It will answer user’s questions clearly and immediately.
					</br></br>
					Google and the other obsolete search engines can't do that. With them the initial search query is usually just the start of a process. It gets you a bunch of return pages and the site owner's meta-tags’ description of those pages. To find the exact answer to your question you have to open one or more of those pages and look for your answer somewhere in their content.
					</br></br>
					Using neural programming, NEUROMAMA instantaneously scans the content of the top return pages for you, finds the exact answer to your question and serves it up to you in place of the site's boilerplate description. 
					</br></br>
					So there it is, you have your answer without even having to go to a website. If that's all you need, you're done. It’s simple, fast, and elegant. If you want to know more, you click the link and go to the site.

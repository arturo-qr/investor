					<div class="style1">NeuroMama can Think</div>
					</br>
					<span class="style2">What's wrong with these search engines, can't they think? </span>
					</br>
					Actually ... the hard truth is, they can't. All they can do is add and subtract. They add that much for a good link, subtract this much for a bad link. They give site points for using the right keywords in its content and take away points for using those keywords too many times. 
					They add and subtract enormous columns of numbers in a microsecond, the Google and Bing robots are without doubt the most brilliant adding machines every built, but they don't – they CAN'T – think.
					NeuroMama's artificial-intelligence-based robots, created with the help of state-of-the-art neural programming technology are the only web crawlers in the world that CAN THINK. 
					You see what happens when you consider all those things Google and Bing can't? What happens is Microsoft comes out number one in any search for computer software. How could it not, no other company comes close to matching its power and authority in that industry.
					NeuroMama.com would never return Microsoft on page 56 or 600 on a search for computer software. It wouldn't even return it on page 2. Because it can think, NeuroMama will always return Microsoft.com Number One, which is exactly where it should be. 
					</br>
					<b class="innerbold">What's going on here? Google didn't always return such irrelevant, useless links. Google used to be pretty good. That's how it got to be number 1. Has Google gone crazy?</b>
					</br>
					Crazy? We don't know. Crazy like a fox, maybe.
					</br></br></br>

					
					
					<span class="style2">Why Google Search is not working</span>
					</br>
					Here's what one of the most respected search-engine analysts on earth, a man who has to stay anonymous because his firm manages search-engine optimization programs for more than ten Fortune 500 companies.
					</br></br>
					<b class="innerbold">"With their April Panda and Penguin search algorithm updates Google top management has made it clear that they recognize their empire is in decline and that their exit strategy is to deliberately generate chaos in the natural returns to force searchers to become more and more dependent on pay-per-click and paid display ads.” </b>
					</br></br>
					"If you were Google CEO Larry Page and hearing footsteps threatening your empire from all points of the compass, not just Facebook, but from better, more advanced search technologies waiting to be released, you might also trade the integrity of your search results for a big short-term hike in revenue and profit."
					</br>
					<b class="innerbold">If that doesn't tell you enough, here's what Daniel Goodwin of Search Engine Watch, the most authoritative search engine business analyst organization, told the world's webmasters just a few months ago. "Now that Panda and Penguin are online you can't rely on Google as your major source of traffic anymore. That's a doomed business model."</b>
					</br>
					One man's doomed business model is another man's gateway to riches, to fortune, to success, to the billion-dollar business model of the future.

					</br>
					If Google has become the search-engine business mode of doom, NEUROMAMA is the search-engine business model of destiny. 
					Our international team of: computer engineers, mathematicians, neural programming experts, and statistical analysts have been building that billion-dollar search-engine business model of the future, and we had planned to release it at the beginning of 2014. 
					Then we saw what was happening with Google over the past six months and we knew we couldn't wait, we had to accelerate our timetable. So we joined with mathematicians from Russian Academy of Science. Institute of Computational Mathematics and Mathematical Geophysics.
					This Institute is located right in the heart of Russian Silicon Valley, in Novosibirsk Scientific Center.. 
					Russian Academy of Science have been leading research and development center for mathematicians, engineers and behavioral psychologists for generations. Today, they host the most advanced labs in the world for using neural technology to add natural, rational, reasoning capability to artificial intelligence systems. Thanks to our association with them, we will be able to go live in January.

					<span class="style2">Russian Programmers & Facebook</span>
					</br>
					<b class="innerbold">Recently Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg was in Moscow, where Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev urged the social media giant's founder to abandon plans to lure away Russian programmers.</b>
					</br>
					I am sure you can imagine what would happen to those Russian programmers, or their families, if any of them accept a job in Facebook.
					The reason Zuckerberg is looking for Russian programmers, because Russians happen to be the best mathematicians. Most professors of mathematics in the best universities around the world are Russians. 
					Computer programs using Neural Technology are filled with mathematical algorithms. Another word for Neural Technology is Artificial Intelligence. 
					99.999999 % of all computer programs are regular programs. They only as smart as the people, who design them. Computer programs designed with Neural Technology are like people. The older they are, the smarter they get. Nobody will best the collective wisdom of billions users of our search engine, and NEUROMAMA will learn from them. 
					There are very few computer programmers in US, whose area of expertise is Neural Technology. All of them are Russians with a mathematical background, and their yearly salaries are over million dollars. 
					Using neural programming, NeuroMama.com is active not passive, it does the thinking, sorting and categorization for you. 
					Sounds like a dream, doesn't it? It's not a dream. It's a reality. A reality created by the best Russian computer and network engineers and the best Russian mathematicians and neural programmers. 
					</br>
					<b class="innerbold">All of the research, design, development and implementation of NeuroMama are performed in Russia, by Russians, for NEUROMAMA users around the world. </b>
					</br>
					What do you think people want from a search engine? What are their expectations?
					Do you think they want random, irrelevant results? Do you think they want chaos? Pages and pages of paid directories’ listings with no real information in them? 
					No. They don't want any of that. They want honest, reliable and relevant, and most of all, useful, results. 
					They want something so simple, so, seemingly simple, that it's almost amazing that no other search engine has the desire or the technology to give it to them.
					What they want, all they want is correct answers to the questions that they've typed into the search box. 
					</br></br></br>
					

					<span class="style2">If you don’t think Google is Ripe for the Picking</span>
					</br>
					Go to Google and type the words "search engine." Do you see what the first return is, in most parts of the world, it's Dogpile.com. Do you see Google.com anywhere on the first return page? You DON'T!
					But you will see Bing, and if you click on the next two or three return pages you'll also see Yahoo before you see Google. 
					You have to scroll through FIVE pages before you’ll see a link to Google.com in the middle of page 5.
					Google, the mighty GOOGLE, the company that is under investigation by at least two branches of the U.S. government for maintaining a monopoly in the internet search industry...
					A company with a 60 percent-plus search query market share.
					</br>
					THE GOOGLE THAT HAS SO SCREWED ITSELF UP THAT ITS OWN RANKING ALGORITHMS AND SEARCH ROBOTS DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT IT CONTROLS TWICE AS MUCH OF THE SEARCH MARKET AS BING AND YAHOO COMBINED. 
					</br>
					Do you really think that a company like Google, a company whose technology is so inept that it ranks itself as  56th  or 57th  most important company in an industry it dominates in every category – market share, revenue, profit, brand recognition, whatever – ISN'T LOSING ITS GRIP ON ITS EMPIRE?
					Of course it is.

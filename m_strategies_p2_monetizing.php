					<span class="style2">Monetizing Strategy</span>
					</br>
					What are among the two most important factors to consider in evaluating a new business investment opportunity? 
					Risk and monetization. 
					Risk … what are the chances the investment will lose money rather than make it? And monetization … is this company capable of generating enough revenue to become a “darling of Wall Street when it does public.
					We have to repeat these facts again. 
					Item: In 2004 when Google went public, no one, most of all investors, knew whether any company – particularly a search engine which, the conventional wisdom said, gave its primary product away free -- could make really big money on the web. 
					Item: Google’s earnings the year before it went public were only $106 million? Amazon’s earnings for that same year were barely $32 million?
					Item: In 2004, Amazon shares sold in the 40s and Google’s averaged under $100. Today, Amazon is selling for over $230 and Google shares sell for more than $600.</br>

					In 2004 more than 70 percent of internet users in America connected to the web through a dial-up modem that, among many other flaws, made it impossible for Web surfers to use their telephones while they were online. Today over 90 percent of users have always-on broadband connections.</br>

					That alone, that quantum leap in connectivity, makes an advanced new search engine a much more promising and far less risky investment than Yahoo was in the ‘90s and Google was in 2004.</br>

					That said, all investments – particularly high-appreciation investments with huge return potentials -- have a degree of risk and NeuroMama.com is no exception. Risk is an inherent part of the investment ecology and no one should make an investment in any company without first evaluating the Cost/Benefit Ratio of that investment from their own personal point of view and financial status. 

					It is reasonable to point out, however, that Google and Yahoo, despite their limited earnings, despite the dot.com meltdown, despite the investment community’s uncertainty about the future of e-commerce, generally, were never particularly risky investments, because every search engine public offering in the history of the internet has been successful, wildly successful.
					Every search engine IPO ever launched delivered enormous profits to the initial investors. Lycos, Alta Vista, Magellan, InfoSeek … all of them … made their ground-floor, private backers very, very wealthy with relatively little risk. 
					With this, we’ve covered this investment’s overwhelming favorable Risk/Benefit Ratio.
					</br></br>
		
					
					<span class="style2">What about revenues? Monetization</span>
					</br>
					How is NeuroMama going to make its numbers … numbers that will be higher and bigger than Google’s within 60 months? 
					OK, let’s start here … </br></br>

					All search engines … Google, Yahoo, Bing, NeuroMama … have essentially a single source of revenue: Paid advertising. </br>

					There are, of course, many revenue streams contributing to this single pool … pay per click keyword advertising like Google Adwords and Adsense … display advertising sold on a traditional cost per thousand impression basis … CPA (cost per action) multimedia advertising that returns X number of dollars to the search engine if the viewer does a certain thing – takes a survey, downloads a brochure, fills out a form requesting more information, etc.</br>

					What all these things have in common is that the more traffic the search engine has, the more eyeballs that see the ads, the more the search engine can charge for each one. </br>

					Google does not make approximately four times more from Adwords than Yahoo does from its keyword search advertising because it carries four times as many ads. Yahoo’s ad count is pretty much the same as Google’s.
					What makes the difference is traffic … Google handles four or five times as many search queries as Yahoo so advertisers bidding for keywords on Google are willing to pay four times more than those bidding on the same keywords on Yahoo.

					Thanks to our unique Search Rewards program and state-of-the-art email, text message and social network user-acquisition campaigns, we are confident that NeuroMama will break the crucial 100-million regular user mark within 90 days of its full rollout.
					This fact, combined with our unprecedented advertiser incentive programs and high sales conversion ratios will enable us to quickly <b class="innerbold">book huge accounts receivables from blue-ribbon Commitments with Monetization.</br>
					Huge amounts of committed advertising dollars. Advertising contracts big enough to thrill shareholders and warm the heart of any Wall Street analyst.
					This is how our Monetizing strategy is wrapped together so it is all in harmony.</b></br>

					We don't even think we need to do much beyond at least equaling Google's capability, because given the current state of that market that is our sense. </br></br>

					Let me ask you a question - if you had a choice of using Google Search or some new start-ups’ search engine and the search results from both engines were essentially the same, would you use the new guy on the block or the tried and true search warrior? There is no question what the answer would be - of course it would be Google. </br>

					What if the new search engine had a little better results, but it was really difficult to tell because you only search a few times a day and they are always different searches so it is almost impossible to determine if the new search engine is better, and you are a Gmail user, maybe you use Google Chrome? So it is a fairly probably bet you would stay with Google, but the search engine would pick up some traffic.</br>

					Now the same questions with a little twist - If you had a choice of using Google Search or a new search engine and the results from both engines were essentially the same, but every time you search with the new search engine you build up a bank of points that could be redeemed for cash or redeemed for thousands of various compelling products or services, plus the chance to win a daily cash giveaway that could be in the millions of dollars … and  this new search engine also is fun and lets you double down on your points, every day if you want, by picking the Red ball or Black ball that is thrown out with all search results at exactly 6pm PST every night - kind of like roulette without the gambling? 

					The prizes from this new search engine make one feel like they actually have a chance to win the lottery - all you need to do to improve your odds is give them more and more of your search business. Oh and by the way, all of their advertisers have joined in the fun also and are giving away their own free offerings as a way to help promote one another?</br>

					This new search engine gives the advertiser a certain volume discount based on them bringing at least 85% of their available search budget to the new company and this agreement also calls for the advertiser to give away 50% of that volume discount in the form of search incentives?</br>

					So an airline may be required to give away 2 domestic airline tickets for every 40th click through that results in a buy. The advertisers that are stuck in search contracts with the old guys are fuming mad because everyone is starting to search using these new guys and we aren't yet advertising with them, but we will just as soon as possible. They also have this cool social network that is essentially free but the very best content and web capabilities are in about 30 of their separate portals and these cost money in the form of yearly subscriptions, but the good news is you can redeem your search points to either get this subscription for free or at a substantial discount. </br>

					An Insurance company will be encouraged to partner with these guys because they have an Insurance portal and they can't accommodate every insurance company in America - only a select few will be chosen to be key industry leaders and will be able to reside in that portal. The company that wins those coveted spots will be very lucky indeed. The search engine users will be very lucky if they choose to do business with these key insurance companies parked within these portals as they can now redeem their points for free or discounted services.</br>

					Now let me ask you the question again - If you had a choice of using Google Search or a new search engine and the results from both engines were essentially the same, but the new company gave you the above listed perks, and many more, while Google just continued to sell your information to the highest bidder, who would you use again? That's right, the chances would be very good this new search engine would gain lots and lots of market share. </br>

					Now throw in that twist to the question where it does appear that the new search engine does produce significantly better results, then we think it is a no-brainer - Google search engine potentially goes out of business. Really, why would anyone stay?</br>

					Google used to give technology away for free - this is what brought them loyalty and more and more search business - plus the fact they had a good product. But now they aren't even innovators anymore and their search product is lacking. </br>

					Google makes a  gross profit of about $24b a year. Let’s say for the sake of argument our company was just as big, but since the beginning we had pledged 50% of our gross profits to go back to those who made those profits all possible - the search engine users?</br>

					Our search engine company would be giving away $3b every 3 months or $32m dollars a day - that is THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS A DAY would be given away in the form of cold hard cash, free product and service, and in the form of discounted products and services. </br>

					This would raise all sorts of eyebrows - it would be bigger than any State Lottery in the nation. Would users flock to our new search engine - why wouldn't they? </br>

					The product is just as good if not better and they offer so many more compelling reasons - thousands of compelling reasons-literally billions of compelling reasons. </br>

					Obviously the biggest problem with the above outline is you need Google's current scale to offer $32m a day in giveaways but it should all be relative to the number of users and advertisers anyway. If you only had 10 search users and 2 advertisers it might be only $32 dollars a day - but still $32 more than that which Google is giving away to those 10 users. </br>

					Now, I am sure, that what has been described makes some sense, but if you take into consideration that we have UNIQUE capabilities to generate traffic – IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.</br>

					There does not appear to be anything to keep people loyal to Google anymore, and, in fact, maybe even the opposite. Even if our engine is only 10%+ better than Google's why would we even need Google anymore?

					We are focused even more on making our Internet Platform to work on a mobile device better than anyone else and for certain we have a sure fire winner. </br>

					We are making it fun. Making the landing page a place people want to come to just to hang out and watch the ticker go up and up with more dollars to win every second or the YouTube video of last night. </br>

					$32m jackpot winner or the YouTube video of that guy who doubled down all his points and lost them all - boy was he in agony, or to watch the special incentives that ticker across the screen from their GPS division - sort of like the home shopping network on television - they offer these compelling deals but only have a limited number of each item, so you have to watch that ticker in case there is something you want to buy.</br>

					<b class="innerbold">Stock market game is the best game. Stocks go up when people buy them. People buy stocks on information. Now is the information age, and it’s the best time to play this game.</br></b>

					</br></br>
					
					
					<span class="style2">Exit Strategy - When will you sell your investment?</span>
					</br>
					It’s very easy to go public via a merger with an existing publicly trading company. 

					It’s also very easy to get information to 100’s of millions of people. 

					<b class="innerbold">What is very difficult is to have a good company, and unless the company is good the stock isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on.</b>

					Due to the fact that our search engine has been developed and implemented by a very experienced, successful, and reliable company with an exceptional team of software developers… our Search Engine has been implemented, and it is better than Google.</br>

					Due to the fact that our partner server farms located in parts of the world, we can get away with using various methods to bring initial traffic to NEUROMAMA’s affiliates’ programs… which at best is a gray area of the existing laws.

					Due to our Frequent Searcher Rewards marketing strategy, NEUROMAMA users will get addicted to free vocations, discounts, gift certificates, gambling chips, and etc., they will start using NEUROMAMA and NEUROMAMA will get high traffic.

					<span class="style2">Getting Advertising Revenues & Stock Price</span>
					</br>
					The team of negotiators will be sent to New York’s, Madison Avenue in order to negotiate with advertising agents. The ultimate results of these negotiations, is to convince advertising agents to sign up their online advertising clients with NEUROMAMA contingency contracts. </br>

					Negotiators will use NeuroMama stock, as a currency to induce advertising agents to work on behalf, and in the best interests of, NeuroMama. Advertising agents will receive more shares for advertisers, which are publicly trading companies. </br>

					Initially these contingency contracts will give advertisers completely free advertising or favorable barter-plus ad rates. However, once these advertisersreach predetermined traffic milestones and certain sales conversion ratios, these contingency contracts will be converted into permanent contracts at the full rates. 

					Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), NeuroMama will book these permanent contracts as revenues and sales.

					As negotiators will be closing deals with advertising agents, NeuroMama will be issuing Press Releases on a daily basis, conveying this information to the public.

					We strongly believe that the volume of advertisers signing contracts will convince retail, and institutional investors to buy NeuroMama stock on the market. We also, strongly, believe that financial analysts will be issuing BUY recommendations on NeuroMama stock.   

					When we will issue Press Releases, this news will be seen by 100's of millions of people. Statistically 1 out of 1,000 will call their stock broker to buy our stock.

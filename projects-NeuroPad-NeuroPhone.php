Other options will include highly discounted vacations to Las Vegas and other destinations, Hotels, Cruises, Airfare, Entertainment, Restaurant, Grocery & Auto discounts (see <a style="color:blue; text-style:underline;"href="http://fsr.neuromama.com" target="_blank">fsr.neuromama.com</a> where actual discounts on the various rewards will, of course, be determined by the number of points required to complete each offer.)					</br></br>					Unlike the vast majority of Android devices produced for the so-called white-box or generic-label trade, NeuroMama’s tablets and smartphones - NeuroPad and NeuroPhonewill be built, per our orders to our vendors,  using the latest cutting-edge hardware components, the newest, most up to date Android operating system, a large number of proprietary operating technology and feature sets and additional capabilities to optimize device access and performance with NeuroMama search, shopping, networking, video streaming and other services.					</br></br>					To reduce out-of-pocket expenses and generate an acceptable ROI on this program, FSR members will be responsible for paying shipping, handling, custom fees and a small upgrade charge to cover the difference between their gift certificate’s value (actual value to be determined by number of points accumulated) and the value of a comparable product built to our standards.					</br></br>					As an example, a member who has earned a $350 gift certificate might have to pay, perhaps, $49 to cover the wholesale cost difference between competitive $350 tablets and our technologically superior NeuroPad and NeuroPhone. (Because our production runs on tablets and phones are expected to be extremely high, our actual cost on the upgrades will be less, in this example, than $49, resulting in NeuroMama earning a profit on each unit).					</br></br>					It should also be noted that we intend to eventually spin NeuroPad and, perhaps, NeuroPhone, off as a standalone hardware company.  We are also currently in negotiations to put both seven-inch and ten-inch versions of the tablet and few smartphones on sale in 400 Latin American electronics stores under NeuroPad and NeuroPhone brand.					</br></br>					<span class="style2">Manufacturing of Tablets, Smartphone type devices and other accessories.</span>					</br>					NeuroMama is in the process of concluding the transaction to integrate into NeuroMama operations, and its growth strategy, a leading and advanced manufacturer of mobile phones and accessories.

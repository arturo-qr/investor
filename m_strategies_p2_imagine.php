					<div class="style1">So, what kind of eyes do you bring to our partnership here?</div>
					</br>
					</br>
					The question now... is what do you see when you think of the project?

					When you visualize it in your mind's eye do you see words and numbers and facts on sheets of paper like the Business Plan you had downloaded from our website?

					Or do you see the completed project... <b class="innerbold">billions of people using NEUROMAMA and getting reliable honest results to their queries.</br>

					</br></br>
		
					
					<span class="style2">Imagine…</span>
					</br>
					<ul class="simple">
					<li>Billions of people who don’t speak English and who had been starving for world-class entertainment in their homes because none of the best programming was available on the internet or on their local channels in their native languages…. And finally thanks to NeuroMama these people can see great programming in their languages…… and billions of dollars that NeuroMama will make by catering to these 6 billion people and monetizing Entertainment Assets. </li>
</br>
					<li>Content Distribution Platform with a fine, ultramodern technology delivering information to these 6 billion people, and our technological advancements are radiating safety, security and solidity?</li>
</br>
					<li>Database of television programming of ethnic countries for the past 20 years in NEUROMAMA’s archives and Billions of NeuroMama ethnic subscribers searching for their favorite programming and watching it in a comfort of their homes.</li>
</br>
					<li>Billions of kids, who previously had spent 99 percent of their time playing worthless video games… Now playing our educational videogames ... and at the same time learning math, physics, history and their parents now are happy…. And have the greatest incentive to spend money on NeuroMama Video games…. Because their kids are now are learning something every day.</li>
</br>
					<li>And these kids are young and their brains are like a sponge. I don't think you have to wonder why these kids and their parents are happy to buy virtual and real products via our NeuroMama infrastructure.</li>
<</br>
					<li>The whole project. Even with a small slice that NeuroMama will have of a 5 trillion dollar Internet, Entertainment and Media industry in 10 years, your stock in NeuroMama will be worth thousands of dollars.</li>
</br>
					<li>Wikipedia and statistics of growth of the world population and how this growth will create new customers for NeuroMama. </li>
</br>
					<li>Even poor and homeless people have little gadgets in their hands and have $12.00 per month to pay for their entertainment…. Unfortunately that’s all they can afford to have.</li>
</br>
					<li>An opportunity to create tools, and make them available to billions of people on the internet, which they use to make their own TV Programming… and because they use our tools, whenever they watch their own created content… they also see our commercials. To do this, we are forming a partnership with a company, which has developed tools used on YouTube.</li>
</br>
					<li>The amazing thing ... they will make millions of new TV programs, which are being watched by billions, and these billions also will see our commercials.</li>
</br>
					<li>They will create all of their Visual and Music content here, at our Content production facility website, because our tools, which will allow them to edit their content, are very technologically advanced.</li>
</br>
					<li>Your Exit-Strategy. SPO is only the beginning. NeuroMama will have many opportunities to be acquired by a rival company, because competitor’s expansion plans will realize NeuroMama’s value. </li>
</br>
					<li>You will make money on quarterly dividends, and special onetime dividends, due to payments received for our Franchising opportunities… At the end NeuroMama will participate in many mergers, where NeuroMama will always retain control.</li>
</br>
					<li>Other projects, other deals that get thrown at you.</li>

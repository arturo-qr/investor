					</br></br>
					Every traveler knows, a journey is a lot less risky when you have directions. Therefore, NEUROMAMA, LTD.Has clearly defined its long term goal, which is to create the portfolio of entertainment and internet assets by producing its own content, acquiring content produced by other companies, as well as acquiring companies, which own libraries of entertainment and internet assets. As a part of the distribution goals, NeuroMama will license its content to US and foreign distributors of entertainment content, NeuroMama's will also package its own or licensed content, develop new TV channels,  and distribute this channels by connecting it to existing cable and satellite networks.
					</br></br>
					To achieve this goals NEUROMAMA will need resources. This project has been selected as the interim vehicle for the development of these resources, which will consists of a search engine, online retailing and streaming platforms to broadcast to potential 7 billion people market.
					</br></br>
					We want to give access to the best financial research resources to users of NeuroMama Content Distribution Platform. We had created the most comprehensive portal for the most discriminating investors and professionals in financial industry, who are doing their research for themselves and for others. We had assemble the best research tools in the world..... in one place.... and are ready to make it available to everyone who is willing, ready and able to take advantage of our implementation.
					</br></br>
					Our future strategic assets will consists of ocean front property,  commercial rental property, hotels, sports and live entertainment venues, these assets as well as the income it generates should support high market capitalization and high liquidity levels of NEUROMAMA family of companies equities.
					</br></br>
					Highly liquid equity will represent an ultimate acquisition currency to accelerate NEUROMAMA growth and to achieve its long term goals to create portfolio of entertainment and internet assets.
					NEUROMAMA has access to adequate financial resources in order to launch the first phase.
					</br></br>
					When additional funds will be required, in order to implement the first and the second phase, NEUROMAMA will raise required capital by selling financial instruments to high net-worth foreign accredited investors under Reg. D. 506 Private Placement, and implement Secondary Public Offerings.
					At the appropriate time along with foreign investors, others will be invited as well to make the initial investment into NEUROMAMA, and to consider future investments.

					The Investor payoff will have the following five characteristics.
					<bullet class="a">
					<li>It is simple.</li>
					<li>It is fair.</li>
					<li>It is emphasized trust rather than legal ties.</li>
					<li>It will not blow apart if actual differs slightly from plan.</li>
					<li>It will not provide perverse incentives that will cause one or both parties to behave destructively.</li>
					</bullet>
					</br>
					The notion – like the idea that excruciatingly detailed financial projections are useful – is nonsense. New ventures are inherently risky, what can go wrong will.
					</br></br>
					When that happens, we hope that our investors don’t panic, don’t get angry, and don’t refuse to advance the company more money.
					</br></br>
					By contrast, we hope that our investors roll up their sleeves and help the company solve its problems.</br>
					We think about capital acquisition as a dynamic process – to figure out how much money we will need and when we will need it. The way we accomplish this, is by treating the new venture as a series of experiments.</br>
					Before launching the whole show, we launch a little piece of it. Then we will convene a focus group to test the product, build a prototype and watch it perform, conduct a regional or local rollout of a service.</br>
					Such exercise will reveal the true economics of the business and will help enormously in determining how much money our venture actually requires and in what stages.
					</br></br>
					We will raise enough, and investors will invest enough capital to fund each major experiment.
					Experiments, of course, can feel expensive and risky. However, it will prevent disasters and help create successes. It is a prerequisite of a winning deal.  
					</br></br>
					We assure you that our business model is not an albatross that hangs around the neck of our entrepreneurial team, dragging it into oblivion.  Instead, our business model is a call for action, one that recognizes management’s responsibility to fix what is broken proactively and in real time. Risk is inevitable, avoiding risk impossible. Risk management is the key, which will tilt our venture in favor of reward and away from risk.
					</br></br>
					Our goal is to demonstrate mastery of the entire entrepreneurial process, from identification of opportunity to harvest.
					</br></br>
					It's up to the management, to turn the shareholder's perception into a reality... Not because the people part of the new venture is the most important, but because without the right team, none of the other parts really matters.
					</br></br>
					What and whom we know are matters of insight and experience. How familiar the team members with industry players and dynamics? We are, not surprisingly, value managers who have been around the block a few times.
					</br></br>
					We believe that ideas are a dime a dozen: only execution skills count.
					</br></br>
					Although, we are convinced that all of our ideas are great. However, in case we had made some mistakes, they'll make a switch for another idea, and shareholders will make money one way or the other.

					<div class="style1">Content Delivery Platform or Content Distribution Network (CDP)</div>
					</br>

					<span class="style2">Developing CDP in conjunction with our partner, Europe's largest, most modern streaming media and digital data transfer provider.</span>
					</br>
					NeuroMama Media’s totally new, totally scalable Content Distribution Platform is the world’s first and only CDP designed from the ground up to meet and exceed Web 2.0’s extremely rigorous speed and bandwidth optimization requirements while still working seamlessly with the legacy web. 

					Simply put, our CDP designed to provide the quantum improvements in bandwidth flow rate, capacity and compression needed to satisfy Web 2.0’s demand for an internet backbone that will support seamless real-time collaboration between groups of people all over the world simultaneously working with the same online documents and software.

					By January our CDP will also be out of the lab and beta tested in the field, where it will be serving streaming video, music, and information from a billion dollar - 150 state-of-the-art data centers strategically located on five continents to minimize ping times and maximum available download speeds to users in every corner of the world.

					What does having this advanced content distribution platform mean to us, to our earnings, to our unstoppable drive to get very rich, very fast?

					<span class="style2">Let’s use Netflix as an example. Netflix...</span>
					</br>
					Netflix now claims that it delivers thousands of Netflix Instant streams in "high-definition." But that claim is not true. It's a lie.

					What they are delivering -- and only with a very small percentage of the programs in their instant catalog -- is a 720p download. And, to make it worse, the vast majority of those so-called hi-def streams are only delivered with stereo soundtracks. Only a handful has Dolby 5.1 Tru-surround sound, and even that -- like 720p itself -- is pretty much an obsolete standard in today's high-definition world.

					Today, high-definition is defined by the Blue-ray standard of 1080p video and Dolby EX 7.1 or DTS Tru-surround audio. But Netflix can't deliver that, its content delivery platform isn't robust enough, its distribution pipelines aren't wide enough.

					But our pipes are wide enough. Our advanced technology is robust enough. Our first streaming service prototype, <b class="innerbold">TViMama.com</b> is able to stream full 1080p high-definition movies, and TV shows throughout the world ... TODAY, and our partner has been delivering it for a few years to their subscribers.

					More than this, however, our next generation content delivery platform will enable us to offer competitors for all the major web players -- from Amazon, to eBay, to YouTube, to Facebook -- faster, more efficient, lower cost access to customers than they can get anywhere else.

					Will we eventually decide to go head to head with these billion-dollar companies ourselves or will we become the world-standard content delivery provider for the next wave of Amazon-like mega-companies?

					Frankly, except in one case, we don't know yet. But we do know ... it doesn't matter. Either way, possession of the world's most advanced content delivery platform will add billions to our bottom-line and tens of billions to our market capitalization.

					Is it something like what Facebook is now frantically building -- a pre-fab, third-party, search engine tacked onto the side of a social network like an ungainly afterthought?
					Or is it a search-engine with a barely integrated social network hanging onto it by an umbilical cord in the manner of Google and Google Plus?
					No, actually it is neither of these things. It follows no existing model. It is NeuroMama.com and it is unique both on earth and in cyberspace … the first … the first and only internet portal to fully integrate every facet and function of both social networks, Video-On-Demand and search engines into a single elegant, flawlessly performing online environment.

					<span class="style2">Focus Group</span>
					</br>
					Recently, Advertising Age had a story about student media habits. They put electronic monitors on a few hundred students and tracked their media access. 
					The results were kind of stunning: <b class="innerbold">The students changed the medium they were looking at or accessing an average of 27 times an hour. Twenty-seven! Can you believe that, 27 times an hour?</b></br>
					Now that doesn’t mean they used 27 different services or devices. It meant they moved from one thing to another 27 times. Like from Facebook to Google, back to Facebook, to Twitter, to a cell phone, than back to Google, somewhere else to access a song, back to Facebook, Google, Twitter, the bathroom … whoops, scratch that, bathroom visits weren’t tallied, the potty wasn’t considered a media device, though most of the kids were using their cells or tablets while on it.
					Anyway, depending on how you look at these things, it was either amazing or horrible.

					</br>
					But here’s the point. <b class="innerbold">Once people enter the NeuroMama.com domain they won’t have to leave to go to a social network site, their social network and thousands of other social networks created by and for people of like interests will be right there.</b></br>
					They won’t have to leave NeuroMama.com to run a search. <b class="innerbold">They’ll have the world’s most advanced search engine right there in front of them at the top of every page. </b></br>
					They won’t have to leave our site to play music or videos, players for virtually every codec will be integrated into our user interface. They’ll even be able to send text messages and post Twitter Tweets directly from NeuroMama.com using plug-in applets. 
					And of course, of course, all the latest and greatest games from BigIdeasTech.com in-house and contract developers will be available first on NeuroMama.com.
					By the way, I’m not joking about NeuroMama.com having the world’s most advanced search engine either. 
					</br></br>
					
					
					
					
					
					
					
					
					<span class="style2">Google hasn’t changed</span>
					</br>
					Or even upgraded its basic technology since the day it launched in 1998. 
					It’s constantly refined and re-writing its algorithms to keep pace with changes in web design and function and, of course, it’s vastly upgraded its hardware and response time. But it’s still doing the same thing exactly the same way it did almost 12 years ago. 
					And 12 years is an eternity in technology, so much of an eternity that there are kids in fifth grade who could earn a living beating up on Googlebot for local companies wanting to spam their way into a better return position. 
					Seriously, you don’t have to be a rocket scientist to figure out how to spam Google by buying back-links and Google knows that a hell of a lot of website operators are doing it. But re-programming their whole system to end the hacking would cost more millions than they want to spend.
					This puts them in the same straight jacket Yahoo was in.
					Here’s all you need to know to recognize this as the multi-billion dollar company it is, when the NeuroMama.com search engine goes live in Q4 <b class="innerbold">it will be the most advanced search engine in the world. The only search engine with robots that rank pages using neural reasoning instead of simple point-counting algorithms.</b></br>
					And the search engine is only part of the NeuroMama.com value proposition, the smaller part. The other  part, the part destined to do to Facebook what Facebook did to MySpace and Myspace did to Yahoo Groups and Yahoo Groups did to User News Groups is the social network.

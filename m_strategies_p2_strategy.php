					<span class="style2">Strategy</span>
					</br>
					Facebook, Google and the other obsolete search engines are lacking it. Why? With them the initial search query is usually just the start of a process. It gets you a bunch of return pages and the site owner's met-tags description of those pages. To find the exact answer to your question you have to open one or more of those pages and look for your answer somewhere in their content.

					Using neural programming, NEUROMAMA instantaneously scans the content of the top return pages for you, finds the exact answer to your question and serves it up to you in place of the site's boilerplate description, <b class="innerbold">WHICH CREATES SPACE FOR ADVERTISING ON ALL MOBIL DEVICES!!!!! </b>

					So there it is, you have your answer without even having to go to a website. If that's all you need, you're done. It’s simple, fast, and elegant. If you want to know more, you click the link and go to the site. 

					NeuroMama's artificial-intelligence-based robots, created with the help state-of-the-art neural programming technology are the only web crawlers in the world that CAN THINK. 

					They recognize the intrinsic factors that make a site important in relation to a given search term. Factors like the size, earnings and market share of the company, the number of products it makes relative to its competitors, the number of documents downloaded from its site every day, the volume of support requests it gets... 

					You see what happens when you consider all those things Google and Bing can't? What happens is Microsoft comes out number one in any search for computer software. How could it not, no other company comes close to matching its power and authority in that industry.

					PureGlobeSearch.com would never return Microsoft on page 56 or 600 on a search for computer software. It wouldn't even return it on page 2. Because it can think, NeuroMama will always return Microsoft.com Number One, which is exactly where it should be.

					<span class="style2">Who is Google?</span>
					</br>
					There’s no way to avoid it. As of 2012, Google is, as the cliché goes, the 800 pound gorilla. Its search market share is more than all the major search engines combined. Its revenues and profits scale off the chart when graphed next to its competitors.

					That’s Google. It’s invincible, unassailable, and eternal.
					You really think so? 
					Let me read that sentence again with two small changes …

					As of <b class="innerbold">2001, Yahoo</b> is, as the cliché goes, the 800 pound gorilla, its basic search market share is more than all the other major search engines combined, its revenues and profits scale off the chart when graphed next to its competitors.

					That’s right. When Google launched in late 1998 <b class="innerbold">YAHOO WAS EVERYTHING</b> that Google is today. But Google, using link-analysis technology instead of Yahoo’s industry-standard keyword counting model, toppled --- totally toppled Yahoo and the other engines within just three years. </br></br>

					Google’s new way of structuring website ranking algorithms was simply better than the older methods. So much better that all the other search engines eventually had to copy it. But by then, it was too late, Google ruled.

					How far did the mighty fall when Google appeared on the scene? Well, consider this, Yahoo, the former 800 pound gorilla, fell so far that it simply gave up for about five years and licensed the right to access Google’s index and present Google’s returns as its own.

					So … to say that Google’s 1998 launch was responsible for a sea change in search engine technology is a massive understatement. What it actually created was a planetary change.</br>


					Whatever one calls it, however, sea change or planetary change or intergalactic change, <b class="innerbold">it is still a 15-year-old change, a 20th Century change, an antique – as computer technology time is measured – change.</b>

					Yes, to be sure, Google and the other engines have for better or worse (worse, according to most experts, in the case of Google’s recent Panda and Penguin updates) continuously tweaked, refined and massaged the mathematical algorithms that apply their ranking rules. The basic codes, however, the assumptions about what makes a site good or bad, an authority or not an authority, are still the same as when they were written in the mid-90s.

					They are still rooted in a world where more than 90 percent of internet connections were made through temporary, snail-paced dialup connections. A world where e-commerce was still an untried, entirely unproven concept. A world where no one searched the web for movies, music or games because there were none to be found. 

					A world where the World Wide Web -- which only became available to the general public in 1994 – was itself a new arrival on the Internet scene, a baby with an enormous amount of potential that few people at the time could even begin to define.</br>

					Google today is exactly where Yahoo was in 1998, an industry-leading, 38 billion-a-year Goliath sitting contentedly on its mountaintop. 

					A fat, lazy, unmotivated goliath sitting contentedly on a mountain of obsolete algorithms waiting for a young gun David with sling full of 21st Century technology to come along and blow it off its perch.

					Let me correct, I called Google fat and lazy and technologically backward.</br>

					That’s not true. Google is a fantastic company and it’s really still in its infancy. Wherever it is on the Fortune 1000 right now, it will be twice as high in ten years … or probably five.

					<b class="innerbold">It is not fat, lazy and technologically backward … EXCEPT, EXCEPT … EXCEPT IN ITS CORE BUSINESS … EXCEPT IN SEARCH … EXCEPT IN ITS CORE SEARCH ENGINE BUSINESS. 
					</b>Ridiculous as it sounds, <b class="innerbold">they’ve outgrown the search business. </b></br>

					<b class="innerbold">They’ve topped out.</b></br>

					They Justice Department had already questioned whether their 63% market share constitutes an illegal monopoly. If they get any bigger in search those questions will be transformed into indictments.

					So, Google executives have made a very wise and conscious decision to let Google Search coast while they use the capital and R&D assets generated by the search engine to conquer new worlds.

					I have to give you a quote … this is word for word from Google’s own “company philosophy” webpage. It’s #2 in a list of “Ten things we know to be true.”
					“It’s best to do one thing really, really well. We do search.”
					Doing search really well. That’s what Google claims it’s doing. That’s what Google used to do. That’s NOT what Google is doing now.
					</br></br>
					
					
					
					
					
					<span class="style2">Here are the facts about Google…</span>
					</br>
					The Google Android operating system is the most popular mobile device operating system in the world. Month after month, four times more Android phones and tablets are activated than Apple iPhones and iPads.
					On average, Google releases three-to-four new versions of Android every year. That eats up an incredible amount of financial and engineering resources. Resources that are not available to upgrade and improve the Google Search Engine.
					</br></br><b class="innerbold">And there is more …</b></br>
					Google launched its new Fiber Space ISP service in Kansas City. Fiber Space is simply the fastest commercial internet service on earth. With 1 gigabyte per second download speeds, it is 10 times faster than the current fastest consumer connection technology, FIOS … it is 100 times faster than average broadband ISP service.
					Google’s Fiber Space allows users to download full-length, high-definition movies in seven seconds. It gives consumers in their homes download and upload internet access at speeds almost as fast as those available to Pentagon mission planners.
					Google’s Fiber Space build out plan calls for making it available in every major U.S. market within 10 years at a cost, according to most experts, of more than $20 billion in cash and untold billions in R&D costs.
					<b class="innerbold">Virtually all those billions will come out of search engine revenues, leaving little or nothing available for updating its 1998 search-engine technology to 21st Century standards.</b></br>
					Google is also investing billions of dollars in initiatives aimed at becoming a significant player in the technology hardware market.  Starting with today’s Google TV consoles and Google Nexus Tablets, Google planners look toward a future where Google laptops and other hardware devices running a new Google operating system will go head to head with Windows and Apple OS based hardware.
					</br></br>


					<span class="style2">GOOGLE IS NO LONGER A SEARCH ENGINE COMPANY.</span>
					</br><b class="innerbold">
					Google is a conglomerate draining its one reliable cash cow – the Google search engine – to support all its other far-flung enterprises.
					NeuroMama.com is the COMPANY GOOGLE USED TO BE. The company dedicated to doing one thing – and only one thing – really well. And that THING … that THING IS SEARCH. 
					Oh, but that's GOOGLE, you say. Google is the King Kong of the internet. Of course it opened at $85, it was sure thing. No … no … Google WAS NOT a sure thing in 2004. It was not KING KONG, it was just one of a dozen similarly sized Kong’s fighting for search engine marketing share. </br></br>

					All those dozens of revenue streams feeding Google's $3 billion or so quarterly profits today didn't even exist in 2004.</b>

					<span class="style2">Blind Man Theory</span>
					</br>
					<b class="innerbold">Ask yourself what you see when you look at this project, and take a minute to look at through your mind's eye.</b>

					You know, if you asked a thousand people if a blind man can see, 999 would give you the wrong answer.
					They would say, "of course, a blind man can't see ... he's blind."
					But they'd be wrong they’d be as wrong as the 999 of 1000 people who never recognize a good investment when it is put in front of them....
					You know why so many people can't recognize a good investment when it is put in front of them?  It’s because they look at it through the wrong set of eyes.
					You need more than 20-20 eyesight to recognize a good investment, you need 20-20 vision ... and vision is not the same thing as eyesight.
					The blind man ... "sees" through his fingertips, through his nose.... through an enhanced ability to hear and locate sounds....
					The blind man.... sees through a heightened awareness of space and place and the environment around him.
					Some people might call the way the blind man sees a kind of extrasensory perception, but, you know, what he is really doing is using a different set of “eyes” than you and I use.
					What the blind man is doing ... is using his mind's eye ... He is taking all this input from his physical and mental senses, and in his brain he is assembling it into a picture that is projected on what some people call the mind's eye and others call the mirror in the mind.</br></br>

					Either way, call it anything, what he is doing is seeing with a different set of eyes.
					Here is an interesting war story ... it has nothing to do with Search Engines, CDN, Internet, Google or investments ... but it's an interesting war story and it makes a point.
					In the beginning of the Korean War, American forces have been pushed back until there is a good chance they will be driven from the Korea altogether.
					To relieve the pressure on his troops, General MacArthur, who had commanded all the American troops in the Pacific during World War II and was still Commander in Chief of the Pacific at this time... proposed an amphibious landing behind the enemy lines at a place called Inchon.
					As it turned out Inchon was probably one of the worst places in the world to try and launch an invasion. 
					The tides changed not twice, but four times, a day by as much as 30 feet... 
					At low tide there were mudflats for miles in each direction of the beaches, at high tide the water was too high and the winds were usually too strong to get landing craft full of troops, which are very unmaneuverable and tend to get swamped and turn over easily, to the beach.
					Did you know that tides have regular cycles ... the difference between high tide and low tide is greater at the beginning of each 28-day cycle and less at the end...
					And MacArthur and his planners they figured that the only day even remotely possible to land any boats at all on Inchon would be the last day of one of those cycles....

					<b class="innerbold">But those natural obstacles were only part of the problem... </b></br></br>

					There was also this.... </br></br>

					To get to Inchon the ships carrying the landing craft and the Marines who were going ashore had to pass through a channel that was only wide enough for them to go in single file.... and on either side of that channel were small islands -- some of which were fortified with artillery by the North Koreans .... so the ships would have to somehow sneak by those islands,  single file, in total darkness, moving so slowly -- to avoid making noise -- that there would be barely enough power to steer in these very treacherous waters ....

					And everyone ... all the 999 out of a thousand people who would say that a blind man can't see ... said it was madness to attempt an amphibious landing at Inchon...
					MacArthur's staff all said it, though they knew better than they say it to him...
					A general and an admiral sent to examine the plans and talk to MacArthur reported back to President Truman that MacArthur was insane...
					The Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon studied every aspect of the proposed invasion and refused to sanction it.... 
					But MacArthur was still commanding the forces at the scene and he ordered the invasion and it was ... it was ... as history tells us ...  a stunning success, one of the most amazing feats in the history of naval warfare...</br></br>

					Where all the other generals and admirals and strategic planners looked at the maps and charts and weather data and tide tables and estimates of enemy strength and all that stuff and saw disaster.... MacArthur.... well, MacArthur ... he kind of looked "through" the maps and charts rather than at them.</br>

					<b class="innerbold">He saw what it would mean to the besieged troops already trapped in Korea if the invasion succeeded -- and that gave him the vision to see what he needed to do to make it succeed.</b>
					Where everyone else looked at the data and saw gloom and doom, MacArthur looked beyond it and saw GLORY.</br>

					In other words, he looked at things with a different set of eyes and that's what made him the greatest military genius of the 20th Century.

					<span class="style2">NeuroMama.com – The Search Engine based on Neural Technology</span>
					</br>
					NeuroMama.com is a websearch engine engineered and powered exclusively by 21st Century technology. It is a unique search technology product of collaboration between a gold-standard team of application developers in many countries and Russia’s leading research and development centers for mathematicians, engineers and behavioral psychologists using neural technology principles to add natural, rational reasoning and learning capability to artificial intelligence systems.
					</br></br>
					The neural technology patents (soon to be filed in Russia and US) enable the NeuroMama.com search engine to produce results analyzed from elements like visitation frequency, dwell time, drill depth and numerous other complex algorithms. NeuroMama's artificial-intelligence-based robots, created with the help of state-of-the-art neural programming technology are web crawlers that can think and learn. Using neural programming, NeuroMama.com is active not passive, it does the thinking, sorting and categorization for you while learning along the way.
					</br></br>
					The fact is that computer systems and programs designed with neural technology are simply better than legacy computer systems and applications because they learn while they earn. Regular computer programs, such as Google’s circa 20th Century search engine, are only as smart as the people who designed them. 
					</br></br>
					Computer programs designed with neural technology, however, are based on extraordinarily complex mathematical algorithms that enable them to learn from the humans who are using them. This separates today’s sophisticated neural programming systems from earlier, crude attempts to deploy programs based on artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence, simply put, is just a form of machine intelligence. It can only “learn” (mimic actually) from its own internal successes and failures. Neural intelligence, as the name implies, empowers a computer to learn from its daily interactions with human users.
					</br></br>
					How much more advanced are neural technology-based systems? Look at it this way, when IBM was producing chess-playing computers that regularly lost to human grand masters, they were using artificial intelligence. Now they are using neural programing and their chess computers routinely beat the same grand masters.
					</br></br>
					Simultaneously with the ongoing, constant and continuous upgrading of the NeuroMama.com search engine itself, a dedicated group of highly experienced functionality, ergonomics and behavioral scientists are constantly tweaking the NeuroMama graphical user interface to make it faster, friendlier and more engaging.  
					</br></br>
					On the commercial side, teams of new media marketing specialists are busy devising new bells, whistles and rewards for NeuroMama’s one-of-a-kind Frequent Searcher/Shopper Rewards program and putting the finishing technological touches on NeuroMama’s revolutionary “Dutch Auction” bid and buy keyword advertising program.
					</br></br>
					Essentially, a cyberspace adaptation of the airline industry’s Frequent Flier Miles customer loyalty programs, FSR will automatically award points to users of NeuroMama’s search engine, webmail, and various other services. Points will also be accumulated when patronizing participating NeuroMama advertisers and NeuroZone tenants. 
					</br></br>
					<span class="style2">NeuroMama.com protects users’ privacy.</span>
					</br>
					One other thing NeuroMama.com does is protects privacy. NeuroMama doesn’t record user IP address or track searches. Every time regular search engines are used, user search data is recorded. Other search engines capture user’s IP address and make a record of users search terms, the time of the visit, and the links the user has chosen - then they store that information in their database.Those searches reveal personal information about users, such as their interests, personal family information, political preferences, medical conditions, and more. This information is very valuable to marketers, government officials, hackers and criminals.Major search engines have collected a lot of personal information on individuals. 
					</br></br>
					<span class="style2">Russia’s advanced school of mathematics. </span>
					</br>
					CEO’s of many Internet companies go to Moscow to lure away Russian programmers. The Russian government urges these internet giants to abandon their plans.  The reason CEO’s are looking for Russian programmers is because it is common knowledge that former USSR and now Russia’s mathematicians are exceptionally well educated and arguably the best in the world. This is why Russian professors of mathematics are teaching today in most of the world's prestigious universities, and best programmers in Silicon Valley are originally from the former Soviet Union. There  are  very  few  computer  programmers  in the world, including the  U.S.,  whose  area  of  expertise  is  Neural Technology. Most of them are Russians with a mathematical background, and they command salaries of around a million dollars per year.
					</br></br>
					While we do pride ourselves on not reinventing the wheel with every new product released, we do know it is important to set ourselves apart from the rest of the industry leaders. We need to make our own mark and we intend to do this with the most innovative and most accurate search engine. We will offer frequent search points to every one of our users which will provide for valuable product and service discounts. We will try to appeal to both the user and the advertiser.
					</br></br>
					Our Content Delivery Network (CDN) is in the beginning phases of development and implementation. This network will be the backbone of all our Internet search business. We intend to strengthen our CDN strategic relationships that allow us to move our business forward until we are fully implemented. We believe the industry has never been more ready to see a new company using technological advancements.
					</br></br>
					<span class="style2">Vertical Integration, strategic relationships and no-cost advertising opportunities.</span>
					</br>
					The Company will receive free advertising time on 4 TV Networks soon-to-be developed and connected via cable and satellite networks to Russian and Hispanic channels, which will reach hundreds of millions of viewers around the world.
					</br></br>
					Hundreds of millions of viewers of these 4 TV networks with music, independent film producers, sports, financial and action lifestyle formats of these TV networks will likewise be exposed to the NeuroPlatform and specifically the NeuroZone promotional blitz as will the uncounted millions viewing our networks via OTA (over the air) or cable broadcasts.
					</br></br>
					<span class="style2">NeuroMama marketing naming rights strategy.</span>
					</br>
					A bit further down the road, the NeuroZone and its tenants will benefit substantially from NeuroMama.com’s planned billion-dollar commitment to purchase exclusive naming rights for all the attractions and venues at the massive Mega Resort/Casino/Convention/Sports and Theme Park complex currently in the design stages to be developed in Las Vegas.
					</br></br>
					<span class="style2">Enhanced Relevancy Returns.</span>
					</br>
					While this is being written, mathematicians, computer science engineers and application code writers continue to work ceaselessly on improving, enhancing and embellishing NeuroMama’s core search engine. Taking our revolutionary self-learning, duplicate filtering and ERR (Enhanced Relevancy Returns) algorithms to new levels, closing the gap between neural and intelligence and human intelligence, surging toward the glorious day when it should be possible for NeuroMama to look at your previous search history, habits and preferences and correctly determine whether you are looking for information on the latest high-definition technology or a place to get a great price on a new TV.
					</br></br>
					<span class="style2">TViMama.com</span>
					</br>
					NeuroMama is completing negotiations to add both new serial television and feature film productions and hundreds of hours of existing entertainment content to the already vast collection of programs being processed and readied for native-language distribution to hundreds of millions of non-English-speaking viewers in Latin America, Eastern Europe and resort, hotel, hospital rooms and senior citizen centers around the world.
					</br></br>
					Currently live in a limited, beta version, at TVIMama.com, this service is founded on the same business model with which one of our strategic partners has used to build a Russian version of Netflix with tens of millions of subscribers paying an average of 40 Canadian dollars a month (about the same number of subscribers as NetFlix at roughly double the monthly subscription fee.)
					</br></br>
					Some of TVIMama’s viewers, a considerable majority of them if history is any guide, will opt for highly profitable paid subscriptions while the others will receive the programming for free over advertising-supported cable, broadcast and internet networks supported by commercials which should return an equal, if not greater, revenue per viewer from the sales of commercial spots reserved for NeuroMama on each program.

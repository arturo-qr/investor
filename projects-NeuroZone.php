The API for connecting online retailers is already implemented. 					</br></br>					NeuroZone will leverage all the promotional, marketing and technologic power invested in NeuroMama’s entire stable of highly integrated, symbiotically compatible projects and strategic relationships to create the world’s first and to-date only viable competitor to mega-etailers like Amazon and eBay. 					</br></br>					Structurally, NeuroZone will differ substantially from Amazon and EBay by allowing both buyers and sellers – TENANTS from throughout the world to connect and do business on a highly advanced, three-dimensional internationalist platform enabling a simulated mall experience in which all of the world’s vendors have equal, seamless access to all the world’s shoppers.					</br></br>					The NeuroZone has a global outlook combined with our unparalleled live-action animation technology, massive advertising and promotion campaigns on vendors’ behalf, reduced shipping rates available to tenants via preferred customer status we intend to secure with UPS and FedEx nationally and globally.With our one-stop problem solving and customer relations department, we expect the NeuroZone to quickly become the hippest and happiest shopping venue in cyberspace upon its launch in Q4.					</br></br>					<span class="style2">NeuroZone uncompromising solution - Socratic Method Search Alternative (SMSA)</span>					</br>					Our ability to develop solutions is a great advantage.  There are pitfalls in which a single slip or misstep could lead to the deadly perception that the integrity and non-biased nature of NeuroMama.com search returns were being compromised to support the NeuroZone and its tenants.Over the past year, our development team on three continents tested and discarded literally scores of potential solutions to this problem before creating one that really works – a simply elegant solution that will honestly drive traffic from the NeuroMama.com search engine to the NeuroZone and its tenants without in anyway effecting the quality of our organic search returns. Without stealing any onscreen real estate from our organic search returns by stuffing promo and ad messages at the top of each page. There are no limitations on traditional keyword search advertising.					</br></br>					We call our new technology, SMSA … the Socratic Method Search Alternative. What SMSA does is analyze each search query to identify whether it involves the end user shopping for something. If it does, SMSA formulates a number of short questions that appear in a box above the keyword ad returns next to the column of organic hits.					</br></br>					As a simple example, to continue our “shopping in famous places” scenario. A search for “bikini” would return the top 10, 20 or 50 (number of returns per page is user selectable in NeuroMama) totally organic “bikini” sites in the usual central column. Next to it, the SMSA box would pose links formulated as questions.					</br></br>					<ul class="simple">						<li>Would you like to visit virtual Paris to shop for a bikini?</li>						<li>Would you like to visit virtual Rio to shop for a bikini?</li>						<li>Would you like to see a list of NeuroZone bikini shops offering NeuroMama Frequent Searcher/Shopper Reward points with every purchase?</li>					</ul>					</br>					<span class="style2">NeuroImages.</span>					</br>					Would you like to go to NeuroImages and see the latest bikini styles in exotic beach locales? (Clicking an image will take you directly to a NeuroMama’s NeuroZone e-tailer who stocks that style.)					</br></br>					<span class="style2">NeuroBot - ranking algorithm.</span>					</br>					The platform is quick, clean and very, very effective while maintaining a total, unbridgeable firewall between the organic returns and the SMSA questions because NeuroBot and our other ranking algorithms operate entirely independently of the neural technology logic circuits formulating the SMSA box questions.					</br></br>					But that’s just one element of the NeuroZone advertising and promotion program. We will also be heavily marketing the NeuroZone on most of the other services offered on our proprietary, wholly owned Content Delivery Platform (CDP - NeuroPlatform). 					</br></br>					<span class="style2">NeuroPay, NeuroDollars, and Monetizing options.</span>					</br>					NeuroZone is also blazing new trails for its providers and vendors by bringing creative financing to the world of e-commerce storefronts with a range of payment options including, but not limited to, NeuroPay and NeuroDollars, straight commissions on sales, pay per click, per per online time in store, revenue and cost sharing, limited partnerships and flat fee per order.				</div>			</div>		</div>	</body></html>

While it is still too early, in this world of cutthroat competition, to publically reveal all that NeuroWorld, which is still approximately a year or so away from beta status, will be, we can say that the NeuroWorld development plan calls for it to do everything current social networks do and a whole lot of things they don’t.					</br></br>					Neuroworld will offer a whole variety of things that revolve around improving the economic lives of NeuroWorld members with cross-channel networks organized by careers, financial goal setting, student aspirations and the reinvention of self.					</br></br>					Philosophically, NeuroWorld will also be the first social network to acknowledge that there is no such thing as a single society. There are only societies, many, many different societies. 					</br></br>					There is high society. There is lower class society. There is the American Society, which like all societies based on nationality is broken up into numerous sub societies. There are societies that are defined by careers and professions and educational levels. There are societies in which membership is strictly limited by heredity and breeding. 					</br></br>					With NeuroWorld, NeuroMama will try with every ounce of our skill and energy to encourage and promote good, productive societies and bar societies that exist solely to take advantage of the internet’s potential as a vehicle for exporting hate, exploiting children, training Improvised Explosive device makers and otherwise infecting our world with ever increasing darkness, fear, slaughter and oppression. 					</br></br>					And lest you think that a social network with a social conscience is not a potentially monumentally profitable commercial endeavor, we should like to assure you that we’ve run the numbers and every university and think tank study agrees: major advertisers, the ones that really matter, the ones whose ad buy budgets run beyond “mere” millions into tens of millions overwhelmingly prefer running campaigns on the sunny side of the street.					</br></br>					<span class="style2">Amnistya Children’s Foundation (ACF) and Amnistya’s causes.</span>					</br>					Plans for the Amnistya Children’s Foundation (ACF), a public service organization which is strategically related to the NeuroWorld social network, are being refined and finalized under the guidance of volunteer directors from the worlds of academia, enterprise and social services.					</br></br>					Dedicated to helping make this world a better, healthier planet, a better place for our children and grandchildren and their children to grow up in, to thrive in, a world where they can truly become all that they can be and all that we would hope them to be, ACF hopes eventually to raise hundreds of millions of dollars for charitable purposes. 					</br></br>					In the environmental area NeuroWorld supports Amnistya’s causes, and will be promoting Amnistya’s fundraising efforts for financing to shut down a proposed nuclear fission plant near Lake Baikal, the deepest, purest lake in the world. This nuclear plant, if not stopped, has the potential to make Chernobyl seem like a backyard bonfire if and when disaster strikes. 					</br></br>					We also intend to aid Amnistya in its efforts to bring the reality of global warming and the melting icecaps home to people. Do you know that 80% of the ice cover on Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa, a glacier that has existed for 11,700 years, has disappeared in the last one hundred years?  Even more frightening, the annual loss -- which was 1% between 1912 and 1953 -- has escalated to 2.5% in more recent times. At that rate, Mount Kilimanjaro will be totally ice free in as little as 10 years. Just imagine what kind of havoc that rate of change will have on the millions of acres beneath that mountain. In Russia, along with our efforts to shut down the nuclear plant near Lake Baikal, we will also work to stop the ongoing destruction of the Siberian forests, forests which currently contain 25% of the world's trees and generate 25% of the planet's oxygen. 					</br></br>					On the cultural front, ACF will support artists, musicians, sculptors, architects, anyone who devotes their talents to the creation of classical works of music or other art that embodies themes of timeless beauty, cultural tradition and convey a sense of trust and security. The Foundation will also provide worldwide support for the sport of rhythmic gymnastics, which is the fastest growing Olympic sport for young girls. It would give them unique opportunities for artistic expression.					</br></br>					In addition to its own charitable activities, ACF, working through the NeuroMama.com search engine and the NeuroWorld social network, will enable both existing charitable organizations and individual compassionate people to more easily engage in fundraising for good causes. 				</div>			</div>		</div>	</body></html>
